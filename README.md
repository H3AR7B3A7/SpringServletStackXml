# Spring Web Application (XML-config version)

## What we did so far:
- Configured our dispatcher servlet
- Implemented simple custom error-page
- Added view-resolver
- Made simple get and post requests
- Added static resource handling (css)
- Added Internationalization (2 resource bundles)
- Added a way to upload a file to the server
  - We will maybe use a db to upload to later...
  - The service for this can be easily switched out
- Added an example of method validation on file name in 'FileUploadController'
- Added a spring 'form:form' with validation through a model
